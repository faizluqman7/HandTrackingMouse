# Hand Tracking Gesture-Controlled Computer Interface
This project demonstrates the development of a hand tracking gesture-controlled computer interface for accessible mouse control. It utilizes computer vision techniques for real-time hand tracking using OpenCV and MediaPipe libraries in Python.

## Details
A simple mouse controller interface that interprets live hand gestures captured from the user's webcam to control the mouse cursor.
Implemented using OpenCV and MediaPipe for real-time hand tracking.

## How to use
1. Download the main.py file (for now) and install the required libraries (pip install mediapipe, pip install opencv)
2. Run the program, a video feed should appear
3. Move your hand to control the mouse cursor
4. Combine your index and thumb tips to activate a click
