Hand Tracking Gesture-Controlled Computer Interface
This project demonstrates the development of a hand tracking gesture-controlled computer interface for accessible mouse control. It utilizes computer vision techniques for real-time hand tracking using OpenCV and MediaPipe libraries in Python.

Highlights:
A simple mouse controller interface that interprets live hand gestures captured from the user's webcam to control the mouse cursor.
Implemented using OpenCV and MediaPipe for real-time hand tracking.
Demonstrated proficiency in Python programming, machine learning, computer vision, and human-computer interaction (HCI).
