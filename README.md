# Hand Tracking Gesture-Controlled Computer Interface

**Empowering Accessibility with Intuitive Hand Gestures**

This project demonstrates the development of a hand tracking gesture-controlled computer interface, enhancing accessibility by enabling users to control the mouse cursor using hand movements. It leverages the power of computer vision, implemented in Python using the OpenCV and MediaPipe libraries.

**Key Features:**

* **Real-Time Hand Tracking:** Seamlessly track your hand movements for intuitive interaction.
* **Intuitive Gesture Control:** Control the mouse cursor with gestures (e.g., combine index and thumb for clicking).
* **Customizable Potential:** Explore possibilities for adding more gestures and functionalities in future development.

**Getting Started:**

**Prerequisites:**

* Install the required libraries:
    * `pip install opencv-python`
    * `pip install mediapipe`

**Running the Interface:**

1. Clone the repository (if not already done):
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)<your-username>/hand-tracking-mouse-control.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

**User Interaction:**

* A video feed will appear, displaying your hand.
* Move your hand to control the mouse cursor.
* Combine your index and thumb tips to activate a click.

**Further Development:**

* Implement additional gestures for various mouse functionalities (e.g., dragging, scrolling).
* Improve accuracy and robustness of hand tracking using advanced algorithms.
* Develop a user-friendly interface for better accessibility.
* Explore integration with other applications for enhanced functionality.

**Contribute to the Project:**

* Report issues or suggest improvements.
* Fork the repository and add your own features.
